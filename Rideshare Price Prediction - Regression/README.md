## Rideshare Price Prediction

### Objectives

This project is created to evaluate Regression concepts, focusing on the following:

- Understanding regression concepts with Linear Regression.
- Data preparation for Linear Regression modeling.
- Implementing Linear Regression for prediction.

---

### Conceptual Problems

1. **List and explain the assumptions used by Linear Regression.**
   Provide a detailed explanation of the assumptions underlying Linear Regression.

2. **Show and interpret the meaning of slope and intercept obtained from the model built.**
   Illustrate and explain the significance of the slope and intercept derived from the model.

### Problem Statement

A ride-hailing company is currently grappling with a significant challenge due to the unpredictable fluctuations in ride costs. These fluctuations stem from various dynamic factors influencing pricing. The unpredictability often leaves users unsure of the expected cost in advance, leading to frustration and a loss of trust when the final price exceeds expectations.

To tackle this issue, the company aims to enhance the accuracy of their price prediction algorithms. By providing more reliable price forecasts, they intend to boost user trust and satisfaction, thereby solidifying their position in a competitive market.

### Objective

This project seeks to develop a `Linear Regression` model specifically designed to predict ride-hailing prices accurately based on selected features. Evaluation metrics such as `MAE (Mean Absolute Error)`, `MSE (Mean Squared Error)`, `RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)`, and `R2 score` will be used to assess the model's performance and predictive accuracy.

### Output

- Jupyter Notebook for model development.
- Jupyter Notebook for model inference.

This README provides a comprehensive overview of the project's objectives, conceptual challenges, problem statement, objectives, and expected outputs. It outlines the process of Rideshare Price Prediction using Linear Regression modeling techniques and evaluation metrics for assessing model performance and predictive accuracy.
