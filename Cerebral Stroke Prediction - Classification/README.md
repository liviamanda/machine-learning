### Problem Statement

The healthcare center faces significant challenges in predicting strokes among patients, leading to delayed interventions and jeopardizing lives. The complexity arises from varied stroke symptoms and risk factors such as age, health status, and lifestyle choices. Inability to promptly identify high-risk individuals hampers timely medical assistance, potentially resulting in severe consequences like long-term disability or death. This underscores the urgent need for advanced tools to predict strokes early and tailor care accordingly.

To overcome these challenges, the company aims to develop a model capable of analyzing patient data to predict stroke likelihood. By creating this algorithm, the healthcare center can thoroughly analyze patient data—medical history, lifestyle, physiological indicators—to identify key patterns and stroke risk factors.

The dataset focuses on cerebral strokes, encompassing patients' personal details, health status, lifestyle, and stroke history.

**Objective:**
This project centers on creating a classification model to predict strokes, evaluating performance among `KNN`, `SVM`, `Logistic Regression`, `Decision Tree`, `Random Forest`, and `XGBoost`. The primary evaluation metric, `Recall`, determines each model's effectiveness in identifying stroke cases.

**Output of this Project:**
- Jupyter Notebook for Model Training.
- Jupyter Notebook for Model Inference.
- Deployment instructions for practical application.
