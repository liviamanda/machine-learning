    st.markdown('''A healthcare center is facing challenges in **predicting strokes in patients**. This leads to delayed interventions and puts patients lives at risk. This problem comes from the complex nature of stroke symptoms and various risk factors, including age, health condition, and lifestyle choices. Not being able to quickly spot who is at
                high risk of a stroke makes it hard to act fast with medical help. As a result, patients might not get the urgent care they need, which could prevent serious consequences like long-term disability or even death. This situation shows the urgent need for better tools that can predict strokes earlier and customize care to each person's needs.''')    
    st.markdown('''To address this challenges, the company wanted to develop a model capable of analyzing patient data to predict the likelihood of a stroke. By creating this algorithm, the healthcare center will be able to thoroughly analyze various aspects of patient data, such as medical history, lifestyle habits, and physiological indicators, to identify key patterns and risk factors linked to strokes.''')
    
    # Objective
    st.write('#### üí° Objective')
    st.markdown('''This project focuses on creating a **classification model** to predict strokes, selecting the best performer among `KNN`, `SVM`, `Logistic Regression`, `Decision Tree`, `Random Forest`, and `XGBoost`. The key evaluation metric for assessing model performance is `Recall`, which will be used to determine the effectiveness of each model in identifying stroke cases.''')
