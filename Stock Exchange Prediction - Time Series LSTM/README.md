## Stock Exchange Prediction

### Objectives

This project is designed to explore Time Series concepts, with a focus on the following:

- Understanding Time Series concepts, particularly in regression modeling.
- Preparing data for Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) modeling.
- Implementing LSTM for stock exchange prediction.

### Problem Statement

The Indonesia Stock Exchange Composite Index (IHSG) serves as a vital indicator of the country's economic performance and market sentiment. However, accurately predicting the future IHSG values remains a challenge. This prediction is crucial for aiding investors and market participants in making informed decisions and strategies.

### Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model using `LSTM` (Long Short-Term Memory) to forecast the Indonesia Stock Exchange Composite Index (IHSG) scores for upcoming periods. This predictive capability is instrumental in guiding decision-making processes based on market trends, economic conditions, and investment opportunities. The model's performance will be evaluated using metrics such as `MAE`, `MSE`, `RMSE`, and `R2 Score`.

### Output
