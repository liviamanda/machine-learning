### Conceptual Problems

1. **What is `Inertia` in K-Means Algorithm?**  
   Explain the concept of inertia in the context of the K-Means algorithm.

2. **Elbow Method Explanation:**  
   Describe the Elbow Method, including its purpose, usage, strengths, and weaknesses.

### Problem Statement

A bank company faces challenges in effectively targeting and understanding its diverse customer base due to a lack of insights into their specific needs and preferences. Therefore, they aim to perform Customer Segmentation using credit information data. This dataset includes information about credit card users from the last 6 months, covering balance, spending patterns, credit limits, payment behavior, and other relevant details.

To address this challenge, the company seeks a clustering model capable of segmenting customers based on their credit-related activities and characteristics.

### Objective

This project aims to develop a clustering model using the `K-Means` and `K-Prototypes` algorithms to segment customers based on their credit-related activities and characteristics. The primary goal is to identify distinct customer groups with similar behaviors and preferences. This segmentation will enable the bank company to tailor their services and marketing strategies more effectively, catering to the specific needs of each customer segment.

**Output of this Project:**
- Jupyter Notebook documenting the data preparation, clustering model implementation, and analysis.
- Insights and recommendations based on the clustering results for customer segmentation strategies.

This README provides an overview of the project's objectives, conceptual challenges, problem statement, and objectives, outlining the process of Credit Card Customer Segmentation through Clustering techniques.
