### Problem Statement

A bank company faces challenges in effectively targeting and understanding its diverse customer base due to a lack of insights into their specific needs and preferences. Therefore, they aim to perform Customer Segmentation using credit information data. This dataset includes information about credit card users from the last 6 months, covering balance, spending patterns, credit limits, payment behavior, and other relevant details.

To address this challenge, the company seeks a clustering model capable of segmenting customers based on their credit-related activities and characteristics.

### Objective

This project aims to develop a clustering model using the `K-Means` and `K-Prototypes` algorithms to segment customers based on their credit-related activities and characteristics. The primary goal is to identify distinct customer groups with similar behaviors and preferences. This segmentation will enable the bank company to tailor their services and marketing strategies more effectively, catering to the specific needs of each customer segment.

### **Output of this Project:**
- Jupyter Notebook documenting the data preparation, clustering model implementation, and analysis.
- Insights and recommendations based on the clustering results for customer segmentation strategies.
