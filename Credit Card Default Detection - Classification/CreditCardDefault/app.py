             increased costs for recovery efforts, and can hurt company's reputation. To address these challenges, the company needs an advanced predictive model that can forecast default probabilities for borrowers in the upcoming periods. 
             By accurately predicting default risks, the company can take proactive measures to minimize losses, manage risks effectively, and improve overall financial stability and performance.''')
