### Problem Statement

The company is struggling to accurately assess credit risks, necessitating an advanced model to predict default probabilities in upcoming periods. Default occurs when borrowers fail to meet credit card payments, resulting in financial losses, increased recovery costs, and potential damage to the company's reputation.

To tackle these challenges, the company requires an advanced predictive model capable of forecasting default probabilities for borrowers in the upcoming periods. Accurate prediction of default risks enables proactive measures to minimize losses, manage risks effectively, and enhance overall financial stability and performance.

### Objective

This project aims to develop a classification model using `K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)`, `Support Vector Machine (SVM)`, and `Logistic Regression` algorithms to predict credit card defaults for the next month. The evaluation metric employed for model performance assessment is `Recall`.

### Output

- Jupyter Notebook for model training.
- Jupyter Notebook for model inference.
- Deployment instructions/scripts for deploying the trained model.
