### Conceptual Problems

1. **What is the coefficient in logistic regression?**  
   Explain the concept of the coefficient in logistic regression.  

2. **What is the function of the kernel parameter in SVM? Explain one kernel you understand.**  
   Describe the function of the kernel parameter in SVM and explain one kernel you are familiar with.

3. **How do you choose the optimal `K` in KNN?**  
   Explain the process of selecting the optimal value for `K` in KNN.

4. **Define the following metrics: `Accuracy`, `Precision`, `Recall`, `F1 Score`, and when is the appropriate time to use them?**  
   Define the mentioned metrics and discuss when it's suitable to use each of them.

### Problem Statement

The company is struggling to accurately assess credit risks, necessitating an advanced model to predict default probabilities in upcoming periods. Default occurs when borrowers fail to meet credit card payments, resulting in financial losses, increased recovery costs, and potential damage to the company's reputation.

To tackle these challenges, the company requires an advanced predictive model capable of forecasting default probabilities for borrowers in the upcoming periods. Accurate prediction of default risks enables proactive measures to minimize losses, manage risks effectively, and enhance overall financial stability and performance.

### Objective

This project aims to develop a classification model using `K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)`, `Support Vector Machine (SVM)`, and `Logistic Regression` algorithms to predict credit card defaults for the next month. The evaluation metric employed for model performance assessment is `Recall`.

### Output

- Jupyter Notebook for model training.
- Jupyter Notebook for model inference.
- Deployment instructions/scripts for deploying the trained model.
